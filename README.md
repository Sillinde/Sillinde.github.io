So, this is a game.  Or, will be, eventually.  If you're bothering to read this, thanks for stopping by.
There is no set update schedule, nor any sort of timeline being followed.
If you can get me to commit to anything in regards to this, congratulations are in order.
I'll work on it when I can, is the most I'll commit to, to be honest.

This is a sort of collaboration between me, the noob programmer, and a friend of mine, Antonymity, who actually knows what he's doing.  Or, at least, he's a programming guru, compared to what I know.
Hopefully this becomes something that people can enjoy playing.  That's my goal, at least.
